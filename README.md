# Digispark as Rubber Ducky

This repository includes C++ code for the Arduino Digispark, a microcontroller board featuring the ATTINY 85 MCU. The Digispark, with a USB Type-A input, registers itself as a keyboard, offering the advantage of sending predefined keystrokes when connected to a computer.

The device functions similarly to a Rubber Ducky, offering an affordable and cost-effective alternative. It is also straightforward to set up and program.
